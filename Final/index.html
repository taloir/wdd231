            <h2>What is Metamon?</h2>
            <p>In a sentence, Metamon is a text-based, community built, legacy oriented, collectable monster roleplaying game that you can play for free by joining our discord. That means that when you play Metamon, you will be telling stories with people from all over the world. Stories that are recorded as you play, and automatically shared with future players who will be inspired by you. The game itself is simple, and only takes 10 minutes to play, but the variety of characters that you will train, fight with, and watch grow is infinite. These characters are hand made by your fellow players with immense love, and more than a few bad puns. As your characters evolve and discover limitless new aspects of themselves, their form and abilities will be shaped by the stories that YOU told. And once you've put your personal mark on them, you can pass them on to other players so that the legacy can live on, and in time your adventures may be canonized in legend. In short, Metamon is the game to play if you want to be part of something bigger than yourself.</p>
            <h3>Where do I start?</h3>
            <p>Eventually there will be an automated tutorial available for new players to quickly learn the rules and even create their own first character. But for now, since the game is still partially in development, you should start by reading the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NlV94T_wz-6aNZt4D5l1eYhwxPqAUw0zy3WuzwWi6UE/edit?usp=sharing">rules</a> and then jumping on the server to introduce yourself and get your first character. We're excited to meet you! Once you've gotten more familiar with the game, you can come back here to use our creator tools: the discover page has a database with all of the characters that have ever been created to help you get inspired, and the create page has a form that will help walk you through creating a new character from scratch!</p>
